# Journo
Journo is a tool I decided to develop in my free time. 
Journo is a tool developed for people, who deal with Korean, Japanese or Chinese texts on a daily basis and simplifies work routines.

## TODO:

## Requirements
  * JavaFX8
  * Java 8
  * Scala or SBT 2.11.7

## Software Design Principle
I will try and follow good software design principles. One very important is that of [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). 
According to this I decided to work as follows:
* Model: Scala
* View: JavaFX FXML
* Controller: Java
